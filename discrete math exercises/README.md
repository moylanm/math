# Discrete Mathematics Exercises

Here are my attempts at completing some of the exercises in the book <em>Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications, Eighth Edition</em> by Kenneth H. Rosen.

* Chapter 1 - The Foundations: Logic and Proofs
* Chapter 2 - Basic Structures: Sets, Functions, Sequences, Sums, and Matrices
* Chapter 3 - Algorithms
* Chapter 4 - Number Theory and Cryptography
* Chapter 5 - Induction and Recursion
* Chapter 6 - Counting

<em>Disclaimer:</em> I had plenty of outside help.
